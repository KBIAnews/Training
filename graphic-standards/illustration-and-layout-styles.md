# Illustration and Layout Styles

KBIA's illustration and layout tends to take on one of two distinct styles. Their use depends on the tone of the content they'll be reflecting and how that content is being presented. Both are outlined below. 

### Flat Linear Styling

Flat Linear Styling is KBIA's default graphic standard. It's ideal for use when the tone or nature of the content it will be accenting is unpredictable or potentially negative. Since it emphasizes sharp contrast and clean lines, it's also particularly well-suited to occasions when illustrations or vector-based design will be paired with colorful, contrasting images.

KBIA's Flat Linear Styling takes cues from the station logo's sharp angles and sans serif typeface and draws from the sharp, bold album covers of the 1970s and 1980s and work of designers like Michael Bierut and Massimo Vignelli. 

In Flat Linear Styling, there are as few skeuomorphic influences as possible. Instead, you'll convey the hierarchy of information and the need for user interaction through typography, positioning and carefully placed strokes.
